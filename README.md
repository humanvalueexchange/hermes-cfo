# Hermes - Chief of Staff and Knowledge Agent

Hermes is Human Value Exchange's local Chief of Staff profile for agent
coordination, continuity, decision preparation, and durable knowledge capture.
It runs on the NVIDIA DGX Spark and is operated as a local-first,
systemd-managed service stack.

**Runtime:** DGX OS / Ubuntu 24.04-based, ARM64, 128 GB unified memory
**Primary gateway:** `hanshermesagent` WhatsApp channel
**Repository:** `humanvalueexchange/hanshermesagent`

## Current model configuration

Ollama is the local model runtime. The approved hot set on the DGX Spark is:

| Purpose | Model | Current context |
|---|---|---:|
| Primary Hermes reasoning and orchestration | `qwen3.8-hermes:27b-128k` | 65,536 |
| Coding and fallback reasoning | `qwen3.8-hermes:27b-128k` | 131,072 |
| Auxiliary derivation, extraction, triage, decomposition, and summaries | `qwen3.8-distill-2b:q4_k_m` | 32,768 |
| Embeddings | `nomic-embed-text:latest` (`nomic-embed-text-v1.5` contract) | 768 |

The models are served locally through Ollama with persistent keep-alive
settings and explicit per-model context limits. The preload unit runs after
Ollama and the gateway waits for preload completion, so normal boot does not
start Hermes with the native 262K Qwen context and evict the auxiliary models.
Additional models may exist on disk, but are not part of the approved hot set.
The imported `qwen3.8-distill-4b:q4_k_m` model is registered for bounded,
on-demand evaluation and is intentionally not preloaded.

### Embedding backend

The knowledge indexer and query path use the local Ollama `/api/embed`
endpoint with the `nomic-embed-text` request alias. LanceDB persists and
validates the canonical `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` contract identity. Requests are sent to
`http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/embed`, use the `search_document` and
`search_query` prefixes, enforce bounded timeouts, and reject invalid or
inconsistent vectors. There is no cloud fallback.

## Runtime services

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| `hermes-gateway-hanshermesagent.service` | WhatsApp-facing Hermes gateway |
| `hermes-browser.service` | Persistent browser session for Hermes tools |
| `hve-intake.path` | Watches the PDF intake inbox |
| `hve-intake.service` | Extracts, chunks, indexes, and archives PDFs |

The live gateway and MCP configuration contain secrets and are intentionally
outside Git:

```text
~/.hermes/
~/.hermes-mcp.env
~/.config/systemd/user/
```

`/home/hans/hanshermesagent` is the canonical deployment source. Do not edit live
profile files or user units directly. The deployment gate requires a clean,
reviewed worktree, synchronizes managed units, and runs:

```bash
scripts/hermes-runtime-drift.sh
```

The drift check compares the live profile, hooks, managed user units,
environment contract, service state, both Hermes profiles, scheduled jobs,
warmup scripts, required Ollama models, and their live contexts with this
checkout. `config/llm-stack.yaml` is the canonical model contract; any model or context
change must update it first and then pass. The 2B model is an auxiliary
deriver, not a memory backend. It handles bounded extraction, title generation,
skills support, triage, task decomposition, summaries, and lightweight
calculations. Durable memory is provided by the local SQLite/FTS5 plugin, and
embeddings are provided by `nomic-embed-text`.

## Knowledge intake

Telegram link/PDF ingestion is owned by HVE-Librarian, not the Hans Chief of
Staff profile. This repository preserves the shared intake and provenance
components without enabling Telegram for `hanshermesagent`.

```

The check must pass before restarting or rebooting the stack. It is
deliberately stricter than checking `ollama list`: residency and the actual
runtime context reported by `ollama ps` are what protect the three-model hot
policy from accidental eviction.

Local SQLite/FTS5 is the durable Hermes memory layer. WhatsApp is the primary
human-facing channel for Hermes communications and scheduled briefings.
Shared librarian intake

/hve-library/intake/inbox
        |
        v
atomic claim -> /hve-library/intake/processing
        |
        +--> native pdftotext extraction
        |       or local Tesseract OCR for scanned PDFs
        |
        v
page-aware chunks -> journaled LanceDB batch
        |
        v
/hve-library/raw/pdfs
```

Indexing and finalization are protected by a journal under
`/hve-library/state/intake-batches/`. If a worker or indexer fails after part
of a batch commits, the next run restores prior LanceDB rows, manifests, and
archived PDF paths before retrying the processing queue.

The intake worker uses an exclusive lock so a watcher-triggered run and a
manual collector run cannot process the same file concurrently. PDF uploads
are copied to a `.part` file and atomically renamed only after completion.
Duplicates are detected by SHA-256 and do not create duplicate LanceDB rows.

OCR is fully local:

- Native text extraction is preferred.
- Scanned pages are rendered with `pdftoppm`.
- Tesseract runs on CPU with English language data.
- OCR metadata is preserved in each manifest.
- No cloud OCR or external embedding service is used during intake.

## Knowledge storage layout

The durable knowledge root is `/hve-library`:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `intake/inbox` | New collector submissions |
| `intake/processing` | Atomically claimed files owned by the worker |
| `intake/failed` | Failed or duplicate quarantine |
| `raw/pdfs` | Canonical archived PDFs |
| `raw/links` | Canonical archived web pages |
| `processed/text` | Extracted and OCR text |
| `processed/chunks` | Retrieval chunks |
| `state/manifests` | Provenance and pipeline state |
| `index/lancedb` | Semantic retrieval index |
| `vault/hve-knowledge-vault` | Human-facing Obsidian vault |

The local SQLite memory plugin provides conversational and episodic memory.
The library, manifests, LanceDB, and Obsidian vault provide durable evidence
and human-auditable knowledge.

## Common operations

```bash
# Inspect the local model set and loaded models

ollama ps

# Inspect Hermes and intake services
systemctl --user status hermes-gateway-hanshermesagent.service
systemctl --user status hve-intake.service
journalctl --user -u hve-intake.service --since "1 hour ago" --no-pager

# Run the repository's intake validation
bash scripts/validate-knowledge-intake.sh

# Run the full local unit and DGX integration validation

```

Deployment templates and secret-handling rules are documented in
[`dotfiles/README.md`](dotfiles/README.md) and [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Sovereignty boundary

Hermes is designed to run without Docker, cloud inference, cloud OCR, or
required external memory services. Ollama, Tesseract, Poppler, SQLite-backed
state, LanceDB, and the Obsidian vault remain local to the DGX Spark. Network
access is limited to explicitly enabled integrations such as WhatsApp
delivery, GitHub tools, and approved knowledge sources. Financial and trading
runtime belongs to `humanvalueexchange/hve-cfo`.
