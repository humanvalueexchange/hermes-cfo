# ADR-005: Hermes Capability Architecture — Tools, Knowledge, and Skills

**Date:** 2026-05-31  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Authors:** Hans Westphal (CEO), Claude (CTO)  
**Classification:** Agent Architecture Artifact  
**Supersedes:** ADR-001 (extends, does not replace)

## Context

ADR-001 established a three-layer capability model: Public APIs → Tools → Skills.

During Issue #46 (wiring `search_knowledge_vault` to LanceDB), we identified that this model was incomplete. Hermes has a fourth input that sits between Tools and Skills: **ingested knowledge from the PDF library**.

A Skill composed from Tools alone can answer *what is happening now*. A Skill composed from Tools **and** Knowledge can answer *what is happening now, in the context of what we know* — producing the kind of synthesis that defines genuine CFO intelligence.

---

## Decision

Hermes capabilities are organised in four layers:

```
Layer 1: PUBLIC APIs
   Best-in-class external data sources
   (Kraken, Polymarket, mempool.space, LND, news feeds...)
         ↓
Layer 2: TOOLS  (atomic MCP endpoints)
   Each API wrapped as a single @mcp.tool() function
   One operation, one source, deterministic output
   Built by Vulcan, reviewed by CTO, validated by Grok
         ↓
Layer 3: KNOWLEDGE  (ingested library)
   PDF library → extract → chunk → embed → LanceDB
   Queried via search_knowledge_vault MCP tool
   Source of durable context: books, papers, strategy docs
         ↓
Layer 4: SKILLS  (composed workflows)
   Hermes chains Tools + Knowledge → complete intelligence outputs
   SKILL.md files define when and how to combine both
   Self-evolves as toolset and library grow
```

---

## The Knowledge Layer Insight

**Tools answer: what is happening now.**  
**Knowledge answers: what do we know.**  
**Skills synthesise both.**

A Skill without Knowledge is reactive — it can report current fee rates or BTC price. A Skill with Knowledge is strategic — it can contextualize current market conditions against risk frameworks from the library, apply tax-efficiency principles Hans has studied, or surface relevant historical patterns when evaluating a position.

Example:
- `get_mempool_fees` → current fee rate is 45 sat/vB
- `search_knowledge_vault("on-chain batching efficiency")` → retrieved context from library
- **Skill: Channel Open Timing** — combines live fee data with ingested best practices

This is the difference between a dashboard and an advisor.

## The PDF Ingest Pipeline (already built)

```
/hve-library/intake/inbox/     ← drop zone for new PDFs
         ↓  (hve-library-manifest.timer)
/hve-library/state/manifests/  ← document metadata JSON
         ↓  (hve-pdf-extract.timer)
/hve-library/processed/text/   ← extracted plain text
         ↓  (hve-library-chunk.timer)
/hve-library/processed/chunks/ ← text chunks
         ↓  (hve-library-index.timer)
/hve-library/index/lancedb/    ← vector index (nomic-embed-text-v1.5, 768-dim)
         ↓
search_knowledge_vault MCP tool ← Hermes queries here
```

**Current state (2026-05-31):** 25 PDFs, 7,454 chunks indexed.  
**Embedding model:** `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` (cached at `/hve-library/state/model-cache/`)  
**Ingest runtime:** `~/.hve-knowledge/venv/` — isolated from MCP server

## Principles

### 1. Knowledge is a first-class capability layer
The PDF library is not a filing system — it is the substrate from which Hermes builds strategic intelligence. Every book Hans ingests expands Hermes's reasoning surface.

### 2. Tools are live. Knowledge is durable.
Tools expire (a fee rate from 10 minutes ago is stale). Knowledge compounds (a risk framework from a book read last year is still valid). Skills must know which input type they are drawing from and treat them accordingly.

### 3. The ingest pipeline is sovereign
PDFs land locally. Embeddings are computed locally. The index lives on NVMe. No external embedding APIs. No data leaves the DGX Spark.

### 4. search_knowledge_vault is the knowledge interface
All knowledge retrieval flows through one MCP tool. The tool abstracts the vector index — Hermes does not need to know about LanceDB, embeddings, or chunking. It asks a question; the tool returns relevant excerpts with provenance (book, author, chapter, page).

### 5. Skills define how to combine Tools and Knowledge
A SKILL.md file specifies:
- Which MCP tools to call (live data)
- When to call `search_knowledge_vault` (contextual depth)
- How to synthesise both into a coherent output

## How to Add New Knowledge

1. Drop PDF into `/hve-library/intake/inbox/`
2. Pipeline runs automatically overnight (or trigger manually):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start hve-library-manifest hve-pdf-extract hve-library-chunk hve-library-index
   ```
3. New chunks appear in LanceDB — immediately queryable by Hermes

No code changes required. The knowledge surface grows with the library.

---

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Hermes can synthesise live market data with Hans's personal knowledge library
- Each book ingested multiplies Hermes's strategic reasoning surface
- Knowledge is sovereign — no external APIs, no data egress
- Skills become genuinely advisory, not just reactive

**Risks to manage:**
- Chunk quality depends on PDF extraction quality — tables, charts, and scanned PDFs degrade retrieval
- Semantic search can surface plausible but irrelevant chunks — Hermes must attribute sources and not over-weight retrieved context
- Library grows faster than skills — curation of which domains get explicit SKILL.md coverage matters

---

## Relation to Other Decisions

- **ADR-001** — original three-layer architecture. This ADR adds Knowledge as Layer 3, shifting Skills to Layer 4.
- **ADR-003** — SOUL.md as live-loaded identity. SOUL.md now points to skills; skills point to knowledge.
- **Issue #44** — SOUL.md → SKILL.md decomposition. Skills are now the composition layer for Tools + Knowledge.
- **Issue #46** — implementation of LanceDB wiring for `search_knowledge_vault`.

---

## The Compounding Flywheel

```
New PDF ingested
      ↓
Knowledge surface expands
      ↓
Hermes can compose richer Skills
      ↓
CEO gets deeper strategic intelligence
      ↓
Better decisions → more SATs under management
      ↓
Resources to ingest more knowledge
```

Each layer compounds. Tools multiply the live data surface. Knowledge multiplies the strategic depth. Skills multiply both.

*This is an Agent Architecture Artifact. The pattern of grounding live agentic intelligence in a sovereign, locally-embedded knowledge corpus is a generalisable design principle for AI-native organisations that prioritise sovereignty over convenience.*
